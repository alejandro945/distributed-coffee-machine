# Distributed Coffee Machine ‚òïÔ∏è

## Goals ü´∞
Put into practice the deployment of a simple distributed software system, taking into account the considerations and factors that this implies, for example the installation and configuration of the database.

## Components

1. Coffeemach: component that represents an instance of a coffee machine, the point of interaction with the customer of the business of this system.
2. Cm_logistics: component that handles the responsibilities of supply and repair logistics to resolve alarms from coffee machines.
3. Warehouse: component that represents the warehouse or site where the physical inventory of supplies and ingredients is managed, as well as the management of coffee machine repair tools.
4. CentralServer: component in charge of the central administration of all the business flows of the coffee machine system, that is, of the administration of the entire business.
5. Database: subsystem with the definition of the data model in which the information related to the centralized administration of the entire system is persisted and maintained in an integral manner. This excludes the local and own data of each coffee machine, which are handled by each one.

## Remotes machines

As group we decide to choose the following servers in Liason network:

|COMPONENT  |REMOTE PC NAME| 
|-----------|------------|
|Database   |hgrid2      |
|Coffeemach |hgrid9      |
|Coffeemach |hgrid10     |
|CentralServer|hgrid11   |
|Cm_logistics |hgrid12   |
|Warehouse  |hgrid13     |

**First Aproach:**

Initially, to check the operation of the Central Server, coffemach and Database component, a student will deploy the Central Server, another the database and the two remaining members will deploy a coffeMach (each one) in the selected computers.

## Deployment Stage üöÄ

In order to optimize the deployment process of our development cell, we propose a relatively simple continuous integration pipeline that will use a local jenkins server to remotely connect to the defined swarch machine and carry out the compilation scripts.

## 1- Mount our jenkins server on your local machine

In root project folder run the following script:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```
If you see your docker process (containers) that are runnig you must have:

```bash
docker ps
```

|CONTAINER ID    | IMAGE|   COMMAND  |CREATED|STATUS|PORTS|NAMES|
|----------------|------|------------|-------|------|-----|-----|
8076bbc623ff | jenkins/jenkins | "/usr/bin/tini -- /u‚Ä¶" |  24 seconds ago | Up 21 seconds | 0.0.0.0:8080->8080/tcp, :::8080->8080/tcp, 50000/tcp  | jenkins

See the logs of your previuos procees to extract first dummy **password**

```bash
sudo docker logs -f jenkins
```

#### 1.1- Exposing Jenkins to the Internet
You need a way to expose Jenkins to outside networks since this is a requisite to work with external services such as Webhooks. To do so, we are going to use a service called: ngrok. Ngrok can expose local servers to the internet through a public IP. The free tier can work with one online ngrok process and up to 4 tunnels. In this case, we only need one for Jenkins, so the free tier is great for our needs. 

**Install ngrok:**
```bash
brew install --cask ngrok
```

**Create an ngrok account to receive token**: Go to https://ngrok.com/ and sign up

**Push authtoken**:
```bash
ngrok config add-authtoken XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

**Create a Temporal public IP**: Take in mind that every time you will test jenkins locally, you have to run the following command ‚ö†Ô∏è
```bash
ngrok http 8080
# https://5b2b-200-3-193-227.ngrok.io
```
#### 1.2- Create a jenkins API Token

To connect our Jenkins server with our Webhook, we will first need to create an API Token to authenticate from the version control provider (Github in this case). 

1. To do so, we need to click on our account and then on the configure option.
2. Click on Add new Token, write a name for it and then press Generate. We need to store this Token in a safe place because there is no way to recover it in the future unless creating a new one.

```bash
114ae705e84a26e1acb7f258612f984ec4
```
#### 1.3 Adding GitHub Credentials

1. To add our Github credentials on Jenkins, we need to go to the dashboard, Manage Jenkins, and Configure System. If a message appears saying that our reverse proxy set up is broken, just click on dismiss. This message is due to the proxy connection using ngrok. 

2. Scroll down to the GitHub section (you need first to have the GitHub plugin installed on Jenkins; if you installed all the recommended plugins at Jenkins installation, it should be there) click on Add GitHub Server, GitHub Server

3. Inside the credentials section click on add, Jenkins.

4. It'll appear a new window. On this window, we should select Secret text

5. Inside the Secret box, we paste the GitHub API token

6. Give it some ID and Description and click on ADD

7. Now we can see this new credential inside the credentials option box, select it, and then click on Test connection. If everything goes right, it should say, Credentials verified for user <My-Github-User>, rate limit: <Number>. If you receive some error, recheck your GitHub API token. Finally, enable the Manage Hooks option and click on save.

#### 1.4  Creating a Jenkins Pipeline

1. To create a Jenkins pipeline to test our webhook, we go to the dashboard, new item, give it a name and click on the Pipeline job.

2. In the General Tab add a description for this pipeline, check the option: GitHub project, and inside the Project Url text box, write the URL for the remote repository to be tested.

3. In the Build Triggers tab, check the box: GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling. This option will enable this build to run after the Webhook sends the POST request.

4. In the pipeline tab, choose: Pipeline script from SCM option to execute the steps declared in the Jenkinsfile for our project, select Git and paste your repository URL. Then we need to add our credentials. This step is not completely necessary but will enable GitHub to set a mark if our test passed or failed.

5. After clicking on add, it'll appear the credentials window. This time choose Username and Password. Write your GitHub username, but in the password text box, paste your GitHub API token, not your current password to access your GitHub account through the webpage.

6. Now your credential should be visible from the options. 

7. Finally, we choose our branch to build the pipeline and the path for the Jenkinsfile. Click on save

## 2- Github repository configuration

1. To create our GitHub Webhook, we need to open our repository and click on settings. Then click on Webhooks and Add webhook

2. Inside the Payload URL text box, we need to write the direction to our Jenkins Server, plus: /github-webhook/. If you created a ngrok account, it'd be obtained at the end of section one. The payload must have both / to work, otherwise it'll throw some error. Inside the Secret box, we'll paste the Jenkins API Token from section two. Finally, click on: Let me select individual elements to choose the desired webhook events for our needs to trigger Jenkins. 

## 3- Install sshpass on your local pc (optional)

We want to automate the way we access our remote machines on the second floor of the laboratory, for which we will use the sshpass tool to inject the password of the computer in question, we know the risks that this has but we do not have administrator privileges on these computers to store our public key.

**MacOs üñ•Ô∏è**
```bash
brew install hudochenkov/sshpass/sshpass
```

**Linux üêß**
```bash
sudo apt-get install sshpass
```

**Windows ü•π**
You cant run sshpass in windows. You can however use putty via the windows command line, to achieve the same thing üí•:

```bash
putty -load "host" -l username -pw password
```

Try it on your local machine:

```bash
sshpass -p "xxxxx" ssh swarch@xhgrid2
```

## 4-Pipeline

1. For managing the postgres server.
    - pg_ctl status
    - pg_ctl stop
    - pg_ctl -D /var/lib/pgsql/data -l pgstartup.log start &

2. Modify the pg_hba.conf file inside data, to give network permissions.

3. Create user and database.
    - psql -h xhgrid2 -U postgres -c "\i script/coffeemach-user.sql"

4. Execute the creation and population scripts to the server.
    - psql -h xhgrid2 -U cofmachu_ssv -d coffeemachine -c "\i script/coffeemach-ddl.sql"
    - psql -h xhgrid2 -U cofmachu_ssv -d coffeemachine -c "\i script/coffeemach-inserts.sql"


Once our data base is configured:

**1- Clone Reposiory stage**

We must pull our repository to see the last changes in our jenkinsfile and code respectively.

**2- Create app folder**
```bash
sshpass -p "swarch" ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no swarch@${ip} && mkdir ./ci-cd-coffee-machine/
```

**3- Copy Source code from jenkins agent to remote pc**
```bash
sshpass -p 'swarch' scp -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -r ./* swarch@${ip}:./ci-cd-coffee-machine/
```

**4- Build project in remote machine**
```bash
sshpass -p 'swarch' ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no swarch@${ip} 'cd ./ci-cd-coffee-machine/src && gradle build
```


## Remarks
Note that the configuration files must already be created when the pipeline is executed. üíÄ

It is important to take into account that the pipeline as it is written may have some errors or areas for improvement, such as error handling in case of failures in copy operations or execution of SSH commands, the use of secure access keys instead of passwords in SSH commands, and the management of variables and configurations in a more structured and parameterized way.

```bash
docker exec -it --user=root jenkins /bin/bash
```
